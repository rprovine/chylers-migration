# Chyler's Hawaiian Beef Chips - Website Migration Project

This repository contains all the documentation, scripts, and checklists needed to perform a zero-downtime migration of the Chyler's Hawaiian Beef Chips website.

## ðŸŽ¯ UPDATE: Shopify Integration Approach

Since Chyler's uses Shopify for e-commerce and authentication, we've updated our approach to focus on Shopify integration rather than data migration. This significantly simplifies the project!

### New Simplified Approach:
- âœ… Use Shopify for all customer authentication ("Sign in with Shopify")
- âœ… Keep all customer data, orders, and payments in Shopify
- âœ… Integrate with Shopify APIs for products and checkout
- âœ… No password or payment data migration needed!

See [`docs/SIMPLIFIED_MIGRATION_PLAN.md`](docs/SIMPLIFIED_MIGRATION_PLAN.md) for the updated approach.
