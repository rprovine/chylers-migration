# Shopify Integration for Chyler's Migration

## Overview
Since Chyler's uses Shopify for customer authentication and likely for the entire e-commerce platform, the migration strategy needs to focus on maintaining Shopify integration rather than migrating customer data directly.

## Key Considerations

### 1. Customer Authentication
- **Current State**: Customers log in through Shopify accounts
- **Migration Requirement**: Implement "Sign in with Shopify" button
- **No Password Migration Needed**: Shopify handles all authentication

### 2. Shopify Services to Maintain

#### Essential Shopify APIs
- [ ] Customer Authentication (OAuth)
- [ ] Customer Account API
- [ ] Order History API
- [ ] Product Catalog Sync
- [ ] Inventory Management
- [ ] Checkout Process
- [ ] Payment Processing (Shopify Payments)

#### Shopify Plus Features (if applicable)
- [ ] Wholesale channel
- [ ] Multi-currency
- [ ] Scripts/Functions
- [ ] Flow automations

### 3. Integration Methods

#### Option A: Headless Commerce (Recommended)
Use Shopify as backend, custom frontend:
- Shopify Storefront API
- Customer Account API
- Admin API for order management
- Webhooks for real-time updates

#### Option B: Embedded Shopify
- Shopify Buy Button
- Embedded checkout
- Customer portal iframe

#### Option C: Hybrid Approach
- Custom pages for content
- Shopify for all commerce functions
- Single Sign-On (SSO) integration

## Implementation Checklist

### Phase 1: Shopify API Setup
- [ ] Create private app / custom app
- [ ] Set up API credentials
- [ ] Configure OAuth for customer login
- [ ] Set up webhook endpoints
- [ ] Test API access

### Phase 2: Customer Authentication
```javascript
// Example: Sign in with Shopify button
const shopifyAuthUrl = `https://${SHOP_DOMAIN}/account/login?return_url=${RETURN_URL}`;

// Or using Shopify Customer Account API
const customerAccessToken = await shopifyAuth.getAccessToken();
```

### Phase 3: Data Synchronization
- [ ] Product catalog sync
- [ ] Inventory levels
- [ ] Customer data access
- [ ] Order history
- [ ] Shipping rates
- [ ] Tax calculations

### Phase 4: Checkout Integration
- [ ] Implement Shopify checkout
- [ ] Configure shipping options
- [ ] Set up tax rules
- [ ] Payment method configuration
- [ ] Order confirmation flow

## Critical Shopify Data Points

### Store Information
- Store domain: `[store-name].myshopify.com`
- Store ID
- API version being used
- Plan level (Basic/Shopify/Advanced/Plus)

### API Credentials Needed
- API key
- API secret key
- Storefront access token
- Admin API access token
- Webhook verification key

### Existing Shopify Apps
Document all installed apps that need to remain functional:
- [ ] Email marketing integrations
- [ ] Loyalty programs
- [ ] Reviews/ratings apps
- [ ] Shipping/fulfillment apps
- [ ] Analytics tools
- [ ] Customer service tools

## Migration Simplifications

Since Shopify handles the complex e-commerce functionality, we can simplify:

### No Need to Migrate
- ❌ Customer passwords
- ❌ Payment information
- ❌ Order processing logic
- ❌ Tax calculations
- ❌ Inventory management
- ❌ Email notifications (handled by Shopify)

### Focus Areas
- ✅ Shopify API integration
- ✅ Customer login flow
- ✅ Product display from Shopify
- ✅ Cart/checkout handoff to Shopify
- ✅ Order history display
- ✅ Account management redirect

## Security Considerations

### API Security
- Store API credentials securely
- Use environment variables
- Implement rate limiting
- Validate webhook signatures
- Use HTTPS for all API calls

### Customer Data
- Let Shopify handle all PII
- Don't store sensitive data locally
- Use Shopify customer IDs for reference
- Implement proper session management

## Testing Plan

### Integration Tests
1. Customer can log in via Shopify
2. Products sync correctly
3. Inventory updates in real-time
4. Cart persists across sessions
5. Checkout completes successfully
6. Order appears in both systems
7. Customer can view order history
8. Webhooks fire correctly

### Edge Cases
- Customer with no orders
- Out of stock products
- Price changes during checkout
- Discount code application
- Shipping to Hawaii/mainland
- Will Call orders (if supported)

## Rollback Considerations

Since we're maintaining Shopify as the backend:
- Lower risk migration
- Easy rollback to Shopify storefront
- No data migration rollback needed
- Customer accounts remain intact

## Next Steps

1. **Confirm Shopify Details**
   - Current Shopify plan
   - Installed apps list
   - Custom checkout settings
   - API version in use

2. **Choose Integration Method**
   - Headless vs embedded
   - API endpoints needed
   - Frontend framework decision

3. **Set Up Development Store**
   - Clone current configuration
   - Test API integration
   - Verify all features work
